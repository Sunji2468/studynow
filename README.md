# StudyNow Flashcards

StudyNow is a website where you can make your own flashcards to help you study. You can write questions and answers and use them to review later. Itâ€™s great for learning new things, practicing for tests etc. I used, HTML, TypeScript, Tailwind and CSS for styling, and Vite and Bun for fast setup. I used AI to help me finish the project and fix bugs.
