# StudyNow Flashcards

StudyNow is a website where you can make your own flashcards to help you study. You can write questions and answers and use them to review later. It’s great for learning new things, practicing for tests etc. I used, HTML, TypeScript, Tailwind and CSS for styling, and Vite and Bun for fast setup. I used AI to help me finish the project and fix bugs.
