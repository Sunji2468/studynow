# StudyNow Flashcards

StudyNow is a website where you can make your own flashcards to help you study. You can write questions and answers and use them to review later. It’s great for learning new things, practicing for tests etc. I used AI to help me finish the project and fix bugs.

What You Can Do
- Make your own flashcard decks with your own questions and answers
- Add, edit, or delete cards easily
- Organize flashcard decks by topic
- Use your cards to study anytime

Why I Made This
I wanted to make a website which makes learning easy using flashcards. Many tools out there are too complicated, don’t let you customize things or require paid subscriptions. StudyNow is built to be simple, fast, and helpful for anyone who wants to learn better.

Tools Used
- React – to build the website
- Tailwind CSS – to style the website
- Vite – to run the website fast
- Bun – for running and managing the project
